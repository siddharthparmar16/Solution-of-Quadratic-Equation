# Solution-of-Quadratic-Equation
A Python script to solve quadratic equations by calculating real and complex roots.
Solution of Quadratic Equations
This is a Python project that provides an interactive solution to quadratic equations in the standard form 
ax^2+bx+c=0. The program accepts user input for the coefficients and calculates the real and complex roots using Python’s built-in math and cmath libraries. Designed for easy understanding, this project is perfect for CS and engineering students learning numerical methods or basic Python programming.

Features
Accepts coefficients 
1. a,b,c from user input
2. Calculates both real and complex roots
3. Handles special cases (e.g., a=0, discriminant = 0)
4. User-friendly output

How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
3. Run the script using: python quadratic_solver.py
4. Follow the prompts to enter coefficients.

Project Motivation
This project was built as an assignment to practice Python, learn input validation, and understand how to apply mathematical formulas in code. It helps reinforce concepts of root calculation, condition handling, and user interaction.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Example

text

Enter coefficient a: 1

Enter coefficient b: -3

Enter coefficient c: 2


The roots are: 2.0 and 1.0
